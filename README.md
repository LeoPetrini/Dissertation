# ABSTRACT

# In the Big Data generation, performing Bayesian model selection in a computationally fast manner is a main challenge in Statistics. In this work we explore methods to orthogonalise a general form Gram matrix XTX, and employ them to carry out scalable Bayesian model selection and averaging in a linear regression context. For this purpose, both PCA-related techniques and the novel DECO method are examined, for increasing p and correlation amongst the predictors. Finally, we consider both situations where the number of variables p is small and large.
